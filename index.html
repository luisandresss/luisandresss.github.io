        <p>Luna means "Moon" in spanish, I decided to name it like that because she is a female and luna's hair gives a vibe of being at nigth with a full moon.</p> 
        <p>Luna is curretly living at my home country "Ecuador", because she couldn't travel with me because she was too young.</p>
        <p>She is very friendly and gentle, she tends to bite everything.</p>
